# Risk Management Concepts

• The average length of time between a new system being connected to the Internet and the first signs of a cyber attack:
18 Seconds

## Importance of Cybersecurity

• "Our daily life, economic vitality, and national security depend on a stable, safe, and resilient cyberspace." (Department of Homeland Security, 2018)
• According to a report issued by the Online Trust Alliance, there were more than 159,700 cyber incidents in 2017, almost doubling 2016 incidents.
More than 93% of these could have been prevented through the application of basic cybersecurity "best practices." (OTA, 2018)
• Crippling ransomware (according to Symantec, about 60% of all malware attacks) and Advanced Persistent Threats are both on the rise. (OTA)

## In the information age, cyber-related risks come in many forms

• Identity theft
• Financial loss
• Intellectual property theft
• Reputation damage
• Data loss
• Loss of privacy
• System damage
• Personal harm
• Misinformation and Disinformation

## Top risk of 2019

• Data Breach
• Insecure Application Programming Interface (API)
• Cloud Abuse
• Malware Attack
• Loss of Data
• Hacking
• Single Factor Passwords
• Insider Threat
• Internet of Things
• Shadow IT Systems

## What is risk?

Possibility that you will lose something of value.
Risk-reward paradox states that reward's value must exceed the consequences of loss.
Always involves uncertainty.

**Risk - NIST Definition**
"A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically is a function of.
(1) the adverse impact, or magnitude of harm, that would arise if the circumstance/event occurs; and
(2) the likelihood of occurrence

## Risk Terms

**Asset** \- Something of value to the organization

**Vulnerability** \- A weakness in an asset

**Threat** \- Any circumstance which adversely impacts the organization

**Exploit** \- Action that takes advantage of a vulnerability

**Vector**\- Means by which an attack occurs

## Cyber Risks arise from Cyber Threats

- There are three types of threats:
    
    - Natural events (also called "Acts of God")
    - Human error (accidents)
- Attacks (attacks require malicious intent - they must be caused by people who would circumvent or violate security)
    
    - Attacks are often perpetrated by "Hackers"
    - Hackers can be good guys, discovering security issues and reporting them to system owners to help protect systems (authorized)

# Risk Relationship

Exploit is the intersection between a vulnerability in an asset and a threat.

## Risk Terms

**Impact** \- The degree to which an organization is affected
**Probability** \- The likelihood of an event, usually expressed statisticallv

* Very Low and Low
Inconvenience of functionality

* Moderate
Reduction of critical functionality 

* High and Very High
Represents temporary or permanelty lost of specific functionalities

#

## Organizational Impact
* Mission critical or critical business functions.
* How are these impacted by a cyber attack?
* How long can the organization survive without restoring functions and trust?
